		// a String with the user's answer, so we need to store it
		// in a Strin variable here give he Sring a name any name yes
		// but something descriptive helps!for example
		// like spongeBob is not descritive but countdown is
		// good now one thing is still missing. how do you give
		// variable CountDown a value?  like lets say i have
		// variable int x and i want to give it a value 5:
		
		//so now if we print out countdown it shows the value the user entered
		//lets' try that and then save work
		System.out.println(CountDown);
// GOOD LET"S CONTINUE HERE NEXT CLASS OK?yes
		

		// 3. Change the countdown to use the new starting point
		
		// 1. Print a countdown from 10 to 0 on the console
	
			// 4. Use the speak method to hear the countdown.
		
			// 6. Use the following code to make the program wait one second for each number: Thread.sleep(1000);
		
		// 5. when the counting is done, speak "blastoff!"
